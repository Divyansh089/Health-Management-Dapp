# Health-Management-Dapp

A decentralized healthcare management application leveraging blockchain for secure health record storage, transparent access and control, and trustable interactions between patients, providers and other stakeholders.
# 📝 What this project is about
Health-Management-Dapp is an initiative to build a next-generation healthcare platform using smart contracts and decentralised technologies. The goal is to give patients control of their health data, allow authorised providers/hospitals to access and update when necessary, and maintain an immutable audit trail of access and changes — all while reducing reliance on centralised systems.
# 🎯 What it offers
Patient ownership of health records: Patients can store, view and share their medical records in a secure, tamper-resistant ledger.

Role-based access: Smart contracts manage roles (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Hospital, Lab) and permissions. Only authorised entities can view or append relevant information.

Immutable audit trail: Every access or modification to a record is logged on the blockchain, providing transparency and accountability.

Secure interactions: Data is stored in encrypted form (or via pointers to encrypted off-chain storage) and referenced by on-chain contracts, ensuring privacy and integrity.

Decentralised infrastructure: By using blockchain and smart contracts, the system reduces dependency on single central servers, improving resilience and trust.

Front-end client interface: A user-friendly front-end (in “app/”) allows patients and providers to interact with the system: log in, upload/view records, grant/revoke permissions, etc.

Smart contract backend: Contracts (in “contracts/”) define the business logic: record creation, access control, audit logging, role management, etc.
## Structure

- `contracts/` – Solidity smart contracts (Hardhat project scaffold to be added later)
- `app/` – Front-end / client application (framework not chosen yet)
- `package.json` – Root workspace manager (add Hardhat & frontend tooling later)
- `.gitignore` – Common ignores for Node/Hardhat/front-end

## Next Steps (suggested)

1. Initialize Hardhat: `npm install --save-dev hardhat` then `npx hardhat`.
2. Add a sample contract in `contracts/` (e.g., `HealthRecords.sol`).
3. Decide front-end stack (React / Next.js / Vite) inside `app/`.
4. Add environment variables in a `.env` (never commit secrets).
5. Configure deployment scripts & networks.
