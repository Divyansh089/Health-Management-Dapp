# Health-Management-Dapp

Initial scaffold for the decentralized health management application.

## Structure

- `contracts/` – Solidity smart contracts (Hardhat project scaffold to be added later)
- `app/` – Front-end / client application (framework not chosen yet)
- `package.json` – Root workspace manager (add Hardhat & frontend tooling later)
- `.gitignore` – Common ignores for Node/Hardhat/front-end

## Next Steps (suggested)

1. Initialize Hardhat: `npm install --save-dev hardhat` then `npx hardhat`.
2. Add a sample contract in `contracts/` (e.g., `HealthRecords.sol`).
3. Decide front-end stack (React / Next.js / Vite) inside `app/`.
4. Add environment variables in a `.env` (never commit secrets).
5. Configure deployment scripts & networks.

Feel free to ask me to generate any of these next steps.
